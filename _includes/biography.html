      <p class="bio-text">David Bowie was born in South London's Brixton neighborhood on January 8, 1947. His first hit was the song
        "Space Oddity" in 1969. The original pop chameleon, Bowie became a fantastical sci-fi character for his
        breakout Ziggy Stardust album. He later co-wrote "Fame" with Carlos Alomar and John Lennon, which became his
        first American No. 1 single in 1975. An accomplished actor, Bowie starred in The Man Who Fell to Earth in
        1976. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Shortly after releasing his final album,
        Bowie died from cancer on January 10, 2016.</p>
